<h1>Python OOP Projects </h1>
<h2>Object-oriented Programming using Python.</h2> 
<p>Programming isnt all fun and games; until it is. </p>
<p>This Project folder will contain various games built using Object-oriented Programming and Turtle Graphics during one of my Python programming courses. </p>

1.Classic Turtle Crossing Game:
- Get the turtle to the otherside of the screen by avoiding fatal collisions with the randomly generated cars.
- When you reach the otherside, the turtle will return to the start position and the game level will increase.
- Increasing the game level results in faster cars, however fewer cars to give the player a chance. 
- Controls: "Up" arrow key on the keyboard.

2.Snake Game:
- Control the snake using the 'Up','Down','Left','Right arrow keys to collect the randomly generated 'food'
- once food is consumed the snake body will increase in length, increasing the game difficulty little by little.
- collisions with the edge of the screen or the snake itself will result in game over. 

This Github Repository contains:
- .py files.

Game runs using python 3.10 interpreter.
